# Application Website

A single page portfolio with tab navigation and dynamic content. When navigating, classes are added and removed to display the relevant project image, description and learnings. I had alot of fun exploring stylings for this one. I went for a monochromatic color scheme, a sleek background image and animations on hover and on page load.

I used psuedo classes more frequently here in order to achieve fill and underline animations on the tabs and keyframe animations to animate the header underline on page load. Within my navigation function I used Array.from to index all the tabs to iterate through and add or remove classes to toggle the display state.
